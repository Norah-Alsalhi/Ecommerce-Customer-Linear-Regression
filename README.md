# **Predicting Customer Spending in E-commerce Using Linear Regression**
This repository is focused on predicting e-commerce customer behavior using linear regression, a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique. The goal is to analyze historical customer data and identify patterns that can help businesses make informed decisions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Objective:
The objective of using linear regression for this dataset is to predict the Yearly Amount Spent by customers based on various customer features such as Time on App, Time on Website, and Length of Membership. By applying linear regression, the goal is to establish a linear relationship between these independent variables (customer behaviors) and the dependent variable (the amount spent annually). This model can then be used to make predictions on future customer spending, assisting in business decisions and customer segmentation strategies.

 ### Project Overview
The repository includes:
- Code – Python scripts for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.
- Data – A dataset containing customer behavior attributes like purchase history, browsing time, cart abandonment rate, and more.
- Model – A linear regression model trained to predict customer behavior (e.g., likelihood of purchase, average order value).
